## Features

- **Dynamic Shape Morphing**: Smooth transitions between multiple geometric shapes:
  - Sphere
  - Cube
  - Pyramid
  - Torus
  - Galaxy
  - Wave

- **Interactive Controls**:
  - Click anywhere to trigger shape morphing
  - Orbit controls for camera movement
  - Zoom in/out capabilities
  - Shape selection button
  - Color scheme selector

- **Visual Effects**:
  - Beautiful particle animations with physics-based movement
  - Dynamic color schemes (Fire, Neon, Nature, Rainbow)
  - Glowing particle effects with bloom post-processing
  - Immersive starfield background
  - Smooth transitions and morphing animations

- **Technical Features**:
  - Built with Three.js for 3D rendering
  - Uses WebGL for hardware acceleration
  - Implements noise-based animations
  - Responsive design that adapts to window size
  - Optimized performance with efficient particle system

## Technologies Used

- Three.js (3D graphics library)
- WebGL
- Anime.js (animation library)
- Simplex Noise (for organic movement)
- Modern JavaScript (ES6+)
- HTML5/CSS3

## Usage

1. Open `particles.html` in a modern web browser
2. Use your mouse to:
   - Click anywhere to trigger shape morphing
   - Drag to rotate the view
   - Scroll to zoom in/out
3. Use the control panel to:
   - Change shapes manually
   - Select different color schemes

## Requirements

- Modern web browser with WebGL support
- Recommended: Dedicated graphics card for optimal performance

## Performance Notes

The visualization uses approximately 15,000 particles and advanced visual effects. For the best experience:
- Use a modern browser with WebGL support
- Enable hardware acceleration
- Consider reducing particle count on lower-end devices
